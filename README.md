InDegreeDistributionGraphs
==========================

A python project to compare the In-degree distribution plots of ER and DPA Graphs with the In-degree distribution plot of no. of citations of a sample theoretical physics papers.

A citation of a physics paper is treated as an incoming edge to that paper from the paper that cited it.

Most of the logic is in DirectedGraphs.py and LoadingCitationGraph.py
